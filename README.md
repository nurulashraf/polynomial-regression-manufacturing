# Polynomial Regression in Manufacturing Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of Polynomial Regression to analyze and predict manufacturing performance metrics. It provides a practical implementation of this regression technique using Python libraries, visualizations, and real-world manufacturing data.

## Features

- Polynomial regression modeling for non-linear data.

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

- Model evaluation metrics for performance comparison.

- Visualization of regression curves and predictions.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Polynomial_Regression_Manufacturing.ipynb
```

4. Follow the step-by-step implementation within the notebook.
